					<h4>October 13, 2023</h4>
			<p class="intro">The mother of Kawasaki Trawick, a Black gay man killed in his Bronx apartment by the police in 2019, led a rally outside of City Hall Tuesday to demand the firing of the two officers involved in the tasing and shooting death of her son. Police Commissioner Edward Caban is expected to deliver a final decision as soon as Thursday about whether or not to fire officers Brendan Thompson and Herbert Davis. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In September, NYPD Deputy Commissioner Rosemarie Maldonado recommended that all charges against Thompson and Davis be dropped due to the expiration of the 18 month statute of limitations. That recommendation came after the Civilian Complaint Review Board substantiated charges of misconduct against the officers. Body camera footage of the incident took 20 months to be made public, said Loyda Colón, executive director of the Justice Committee, a grassroots organization dedicated to addressing police violence in New York City. 
				</p>
			<p>Alexa Aviles, Democrat city council member for district 38, criticized the decision to drop the disciplinary charges against the officers.</p>
			<p>“Accountability does not mean taking advantage of loopholes,” said Aviles. Lack of accountability is “enabling murder,” she said.</p>
			<p>Community group leaders and elected officials took turns speaking in support of the Trawick family, often mentioning the names of other people killed by police.</p>
			<p>“We all know this is not the first time that this has happened,” New York Senator, Julia Salazar, a Democrat, said.</p>
			<p>Public Advocate Jumaane Williams challenged the Adams administration to treat NYPD disciplinary hearings differently than they have been treated in the past. According to a 2020 report by the New York Civil Liberties Union, less than one percent of CCRB complaints receive serious disciplinary punishments like vacation forfeiture or termination.</p>
			<p>“Someone’s son is dead,” Williams said.</p>
			<p>Adams has yet to meet with the Trawick family despite a letter, hand-delivered to City Hall by the family in May, asking for a meeting to discuss the death of their son. </p>
			<p>Over the last four years, the opportunities for Adams and the Trawicks to meet have been plentiful.</p>
			<p>“Every other month,” said Ellen Trawick, Kawasaki’s mother, about her commitment to commuting to New York City from Atlanta to seek justice for her son. The constant travel has caused financial hardship forcing the Trawicks to take off from work every time they visit the city, she said.</p>
			<p>“If he met you, he met a friend,” said Trawick’s mother about her son who moved to The Bronx to pursue his dream of becoming a dancer.</p>
			<p>After a 112 second interaction with the NYPD, Trawick was dead. </p>
			<p>His mother is part of a growing group of Black mothers who are forced to become advocates for their children killed by police. Other Black mothers reached out in support and encouraged her to not give up on trying to obtain justice for her son, she said.</p>
			<p>“I’m hopeful,” she said, about the pending discipline decision. </p>
			<p>Advocates at the rally indicated that Maldonado still has time to amend her recommendation. Alternatively, Caban could ignore the recommendation to drop all charges and decide to levy a punishment against his officers. </p>
			<p>Only Caban has the authority to fire the officers in this disciplinary case.</p>
			<p>Sister Robins, 67, of Morrisania, led the crowd in song and chant in calling for accountability. </p>
			<p>“I’ve got a message for police,” she said. “There is another jail, and it’s called hell.”</p>
